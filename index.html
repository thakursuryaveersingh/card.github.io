  <h1>Step 2</h1>
  <p>This step is the same as the following steps 3 and 4. The cards are randomly shuffled by the javascript. There are now 3 rows of cards. Each pile has 9 cards. There's also a button right next to each pile. Please look for your card and click on the button right next to that pile. DON'T cheat, otherwise the trick won't work.</p>

  <h1>Step 5</h1>
  <p>After 3 rounds of dealing out the cards into 3 piles the order of the cards has changed. If we hold the deck of cards face down and start dealing out the cards to reveal them we will count each card, starting with 1. What was your favorite number again? <span class="your_number"></span>? Have a look at the card of your favorite number. Is that your card?</p>
  <p>There is no trick like saving your choice at the beginning. It's a mathemtical card trick.</p>
